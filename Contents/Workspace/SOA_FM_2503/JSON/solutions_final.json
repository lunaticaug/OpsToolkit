For the duration just before the first coupon the cash flows are \nthe same as for the original bond, but all occur one year sooner. Hence the duration is one year \nless. \n \nAlternatively, note that the numerators for \n1d  and \n2\nd  are identical. That is because they differ \nonly with respect to the coupon at time 1 (which is time 0 for this calculation) and so the \npayment does not add anything. The denominator for \n2\nd  is the present value of the same bond, \nbut with 7 years, which is 5000. The denominator for \n1d  has the extra coupon of 250 and so is",
