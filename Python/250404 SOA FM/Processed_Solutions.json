For the duration just before the first coupon the cash flows are the same as for the original bond, but all occur one year sooner. Hence the duration is one year less. Alternatively, note that the numerators for 1d and 2d are identical. That is because they differ only with respect to the coupon at time 1 (which is time 0 for this calculation) and so the payment does not add anything. The denominator for 2d is the present value of the same bond, but with 7 years, which is 5000. The denominator for 1d has the extra coupon of 250 and so is 5250.

  "454": "454. Solution: E The amounts for accumulation of the discount in the annual coupon payments (amounts of increase in book value) form a geometric progression with common ratio (1 )i+, where i is the annual effective yield rate. The amount for accumulation of discount in the 9th coupon payment is 4730 4478 252 −= . Since the redemption value is the book value just after the last (in this case 10th) coupon payment but before the redemption payment, the amount for accumulation of the discount in the 10th coupon payment is 5000 4730 270 −= . Therefore, 2701252i+= , which leads to the conclusion that the annual effective yield rate is 2701 0.071429.252i= −= . 121",
