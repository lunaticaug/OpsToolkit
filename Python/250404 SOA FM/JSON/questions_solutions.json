For the duration just before the first coupon the cash flows are the same as for the original bond, but all occur one year sooner. Hence the duration is one year less. \n \nAlternatively, note that the numerators for \n1d and 2d are identical. That is because they differ \nonly with respect to the coupon at time 1 (which is time 0 for this calculation) and so the \npayment does not add anything. The denominator for 2d is the present value of the same bond, \nbut with 7 years, which is 5000. The denominator for 1d has the extra coupon of 250 and so is \n5250. The desired ratio is then 5000/5250 = 0.9524."

Let H , I, and J  represent the face amount of each \npurchased bond. The time one payment can be exactly matched with H  + 0.12J  = 11,000. The \ntime two payment can be matched with I  + 1.12 J = 12,100. The cost of the three bonds is H /1.1 + \nI/1.2321 + J . This function is to be minimized under the two constraints.

The company wants to analyze the effects of face value and coupon rate changes on Macaulay duration of these bonds, in order to choose an investment strategy that immunizes its position.  Determine which of the following statements is true about the separate effects of face value and coupon rate changes on the duration of these bonds.  (A) Macaulay duration increases as face value increases, and increases as coupon  rate \nincreases.  \n(B) Macaulay duration increases as face value increases, and decreases as coupon rate increases.  \n(C) Macaulay duration remains constant as face value increases, and increases as coupon rate increases.  \n(D) Macaulay duration remains constant as face value increases, and remains constant as coupon rate increases.  \n(E) Macaulay duration remains constant as face value increases, and decreases as coupon rate increases.  \n   \n96",
    "solution": "E \nA change in face value multiplies all cash flows by the same amount. Therefore, there is no change in the duration. If the coupon rate increases, the coupons become larger, but the redemption value stays the same. This causes payments prior to redemption to receive more weight relative to the payment at redemption and thus the duration will decrease."
